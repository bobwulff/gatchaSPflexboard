# gatchaSP Flexboard

> :warning: **THIS IS UNTESTED! WE'RE STILL WORKING OUT THE SIZING. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

This is designed to be used with the Game Boy Advance SP mod created by [Joseph Tompkins](https://ko-fi.com/josephtomkins) called the [Gacha SP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM45YnBbGOQ).

This flexible circuit board should make wiring the button board to the main board a lot easier.
